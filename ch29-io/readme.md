### IO
 - Haskell expressions which arenâ€™t in `IO` will always return the same result regardless of what order they are evaluated in; we lose
   this guarantee and others besides once `IO` is introduced. GHC can normally reorder operations. This is disabled in `IO` (as in ST).
   `IO` actions are instead enclosed within nested lambdas nesting is the only way to ensure that actions are sequenced within
   a pure lambda calculus.

 - `IO` primarily exists to give us a way to order operations and to disable some of the sharing about non-strictness. GHC is ordinarily
   free to do a lot of reordering of operations, delaying of evaluation, sharing of named values, duplicating code via inlining,
   and other optimizations in order to increase performance. The main thing the `IO` type does is turn off most of those abilities.
