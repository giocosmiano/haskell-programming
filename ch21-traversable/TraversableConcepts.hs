SO, WHAT'S TRAVERSABLE FOR???
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In a literal sense, anytime you need to flip two type constructors
around, or map something and then flip them around, thatâ€™s probably Traversable

Prelude> f = undefined :: a -> Maybe b
Prelude> xs = undefined :: [a]
Prelude> :t map f xs
map f xs :: [Maybe b]

But what if we want a value of type Maybe [b], instead of [Maybe b]?

Prelude> :t sequenceA $ map f xs
sequenceA $ map f xs :: Maybe [a]

Itâ€™s usually better to use traverse whenever we see a sequence
or sequenceA combined with a map or fmap

Prelude> :t traverse f xs
traverse f xs :: Maybe [b]

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
another sample
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`traverse` maps each element of a structure to an action,
evaluates the actions from left to right, and collects the results.
If you find yourself with a value that has a type like [IO a], itâ€™s
possible you made a mistake and used `fmap` where you wanted
`traverse`

myData :: [String]
myFunc :: String -> IO Record

wrong :: [IO Record]
wrong = fmap myFunc myData

right :: IO [Record]
right = traverse myFunc myData

  sequenceA = traverse id
