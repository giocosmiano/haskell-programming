### Definition
 - A parser is a function that takes some textual input (it could be a String, or another datatype such as
   ByteString or Text) and returns some structure as an output. That structure might be a tree, for example,
   or an indexed map of locations in the parsed data. Parsers analyze structure in conformance with rules
   specified in a grammar, whether itâ€™s a grammar of a human language, a programming language, or a format
   such as JSON.

 - A parser combinator is a higher-order function that takes parsers as input and returns a new parser as output.

 - `Parsers` are functions, so parser combinators are higher-order functions that can take parsers as arguments.
   Usually the argument passing is elided because the interface of parsers will often be like the `State` monad
   which permits `Reader`-style implicit argument passing. Among other things, combinators allow for recursion
   and for gluing together parsers in a modular fashion to parse data according to complex rules.

***Haskell's parsing ecosystem***
 - Haskell has several excellent parsing libraries available. `parsec` and `attoparsec` are perhaps the two most
   well known parser combinator libraries in Haskell, but there is also `megaparsec` and others. `aeson` and
   `cassava` are among the libraries designed for parsing specific types of data ( `JSON` data and `CSV` data,
   respectively).

 - If you intend to do a lot of parsing in production, you may need to get comfortable using `attoparsec`, as
   it is particularly known for very speedy parsing
