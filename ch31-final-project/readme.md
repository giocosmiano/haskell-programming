### Final Project
 - Dating back to 1971, the `finger` service was a means of figuring out how to contact colleagues or other people on the same
   computer network and whether they were on the network at a given time, often on the same mainframe in a time when computing was
   usually time-shared on the same physical machine. `finger` was originally intended to be used to share an office number, email
   address, basic contact details like that. By the time the 1990s and public internet access was widely available `finger` was
   also used to deliver `.plan` or `.project` files as sort of pre-Twitter/Tumblr microblog.
